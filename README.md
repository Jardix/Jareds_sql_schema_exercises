# Jareds_sql_schema_exercises

@Taniya

This is one of the weirdest exercises I have done so far. I think I did what they wanted? I think I actually did a lot more than what they wanted. 
Here's the code I worked on, if you read through it, just focus on the medical_center and craigslist. Those are functioning sql databases that when run through the terminal actually work. I put emphasis on that because the solutions that I looked at after completing those two databases...
Showed PNG pictures of a schematic for a database. Apparently I was just supposed to draw out databases like this? Or maybe use Excel? Not totally sure what they wanted, but since the last 3 files they gave me came with the instructions 'see if you can improve this', and I couldn't, (they were pretty nice), I figured actually creating 2 databases was equivalent with drawing out 6? Really not sure here.
